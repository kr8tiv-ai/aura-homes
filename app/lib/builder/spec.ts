/* ===========================================================================
   THE HOME SPEC — the one contract the whole builder is built around.

   The founder's ask, in his words: "we have to create a builder that somebody
   can actually build their own smart homes, kind of like Nordic style type
   deal with beautiful polycarbonate glass ... and then they can go directly
   from a little thing that they're playing with all the way to production."

   That sentence sets the shape of this file. A spec has to be:

   1. SIMPLE ENOUGH TO PLAY WITH. Every field is a number a person can picture
      — feet, degrees, a named roof form. No matrices, no meshes, no CSG trees.
      Somebody dragging a slider must be editing something they understand.
   2. RICH ENOUGH TO BE A BUILDING. Multiple volumes, so an L-plan or a
      Nordic cluster of linked forms is expressible, not just one box. Roofs
      with real pitch. Openings placed on named walls.
   3. CONVERTIBLE TO PRODUCTION. It has to hand off to the deterministic plan
      engine in lib/design/ that already emits a dimensioned drawing. This is
      the whole point: the toy and the drawing must be the same object, or the
      "all the way to production" promise is a lie.

   FEET, everywhere, because North American residential construction is in
   feet and inches and the existing engine already speaks it. Wall thickness
   is the ONLY millimetre dimension in the system, because that is how panel
   and mass-wall products are actually specified — see lib/design/materials.ts.

   PURE DATA. No three.js types, no React, no functions with side effects.
   Geometry reads this; the plan bridge reads this; the export reads this;
   none of them may write their own concepts back into it.
