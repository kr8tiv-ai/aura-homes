/* ===========================================================================
   THE LIBRARY — designs that survive the tab closing.

   Until this file existed a home lived in exactly two places: React state, and
   a share URL somebody had to think to copy. Close the tab and the afternoon
   was gone. That is the single biggest hole in the builder's usability, and it
   is not a hole that needs a server to fill — the browser has a real database
   in it, and the spec is small, plain, versioned data.

   So: IndexedDB, directly, no dependency. `idb` is a fine 1.1 kB wrapper and
   this file is the reason not to add it — the whole surface we need is `open`,
   `transaction`, `put`, `get`, `getAll`, `delete`, and the request→promise
   adapter at the top of this file is nine lines.

   THREE STORES, AND WHY THE SPLIT IS NOT DECORATION
   -------------------------------------------------
   `designs`  — one metadata record per saved home: name, timestamps, the
                thumbnail, and the derived headline figures.
   `specs`    — the HomeSpec itself, keyed by the same id.
   `autosave` — exactly one record, id `current`, holding the working design.

   The library grid renders from `designs` alone. A cursor over that store
   never deserializes a single HomeSpec, so opening the panel with forty homes
   in it costs forty small records rather than forty buildings. (Honest caveat:
   the thumbnails live in that store too and they are the bulk of the bytes.
   The split buys the parse, not the read.)

   `autosave` is a SEPARATE STORE rather than a reserved id in `designs`,
   because a reserved id is a filter somebody eventually forgets to write, and
   the day it is forgotten the user's crash-recovery scratch copy appears in
   their library as if they had saved it. A different store cannot be listed by
   accident.

   WHAT THIS FILE REFUSES TO DO
   ----------------------------
   1. Load a house it does not fully understand. Every spec coming off disk —
      a saved record, an autosave, a design inside an imported library file —
      goes through `validateHomeSpec` from `share.ts`, the same gate a share
      link comes through. A record stamped with a NEWER SPEC_VERSION is
      refused by version before its contents are read at all, and the library
      card says so in words rather than quietly failing to open.
   2. Pretend storage works when it does not. Private browsing where `open`
      throws, a quota that is full, another tab holding an older schema open —
      each becomes a NAMED failure (`blocked`, `quota`, `version`, ...) with a
      sentence a person can act on, never a silent no-op.
   3. Overwrite anything without being asked. Autosave writes only to its own
      store; restoring it is an explicit press. An imported design whose id
      already exists is given a new id, never merged over the top of the
      original.

   NO CLOCK IN A DERIVED VALUE. Timestamps are facts about when a record was
   written and are read from `Date.now()` at the moment of writing; nothing
   here derives geometry, and `libraryToJson` takes its `exportedAt` as a
   parameter exactly as `drawingSet` takes its issue date, so the same library
   exported twice with the same stamp is byte-identical.
