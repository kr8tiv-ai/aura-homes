/* ============================================================================
   BUILDER GEOMETRY — the HomeSpec, made visible.

   This is the half of the promise the user can SEE. `lib/builder/spec.ts` is
   the frozen contract; `lib/design/` turns a room program into a dimensioned
   drawing. This file turns the same HomeSpec into renderable geometry, so the
   thing somebody drags a slider on and the thing that gets drawn are one
   object rather than two models that agree by accident.

   WHAT IT IS NOT. Massing and layout only. Nothing here is a structural
   member, a permit set, or an engineered assembly. Wall thickness is real
   because it changes the plan and the price; the roof slab is a slab, not a
   rafter schedule, and it is never presented as one.

   THREE RULES THIS FILE OBEYS, because breaking any of them is how two parts
   of a system start disagreeing about the same house:

   1. spec.ts OWNS EVERY DERIVED QUANTITY. Ridge height comes from
      `ridgeHeightFt(v)`, footprint from `volumeFootprintSqFt(v)`, areas from
      `totalFloorAreaSqFt` / `groundFootprintSqFt` / `glazedAreaSqFt`. Nothing
      is recomputed inline. The roofs below are built to LAND ON
      `ridgeHeightFt(v)` rather than to re-derive a height from the pitch —
      see THE RIDGE INVARIANT.
   2. THE SITE FRAME IS DECIDED ONCE. A volume's world placement is a position
      and a single yaw, produced by `yawFromBearingDeg`. Every part of a volume
      is authored in that volume's LOCAL frame and returned un-transformed, so
      the scene applies exactly one transform per volume and there is no second
      place for a sign error to live.
   3. PURE. No React, no JSX, no Math.random, no Date.now, no network. The same
      spec produces byte-identical geometry, forever.

   THE RIDGE INVARIANT: for every roof form, the highest point of the built
   model equals `ridgeHeightFt(v)` exactly. Gable, a-frame and saltbox apex at
   it; the shed's high edge is deliberately FLUSH with the wall (only the low
   edge and the two rakes carry the overhang) so an eave cannot poke above the
   number the UI shows against a height limit; the flat roof's parapet coping
   tops out at it. That is the whole reason the roofs are built downward from
   `ridgeHeightFt` instead of upward from `pitchDeg`.

   NAMED DEPARTURES, because a silent one is a bug waiting to be discovered:
   · spec.ts calls `wallHeightFt` "floor to underside of the eave". The built
     model puts the roof's TOP surface on that line, so the underside sits one
     roof-panel thickness lower. Deliberate: it buys the ridge invariant above,
     and trades ~9 inches on a dimension nobody reads off a massing model.
   · `ridgeHeightFt` derives the shed's and the saltbox's rise from `widthFt`
     regardless of which way `facing` points. When the slope is turned to run
     across the depth, the BUILT pitch therefore differs from `pitchDeg`. The
     height is honoured and the built pitch is reported per volume as
     `builtPitchDeg`, rather than the geometry quietly re-deriving a different
     ridge from the pitch.

   LICENCE: nothing new. `three` (MIT) is already a dependency; the polygon
   clipping, the convex inset and the merge below are written here rather than
   pulled in, so no CSG or geometry library is added to an MIT repo.

   shared by every volume, because the spec has no per-volume elevation.

   `buildHome` returns parts UNMERGED on purpose. A part carries its volume,
   its wall and its opening id, and that metadata is what lets the UI hover a
   window or select a wall — the difference between a builder and a picture.
   The default home is about 30 parts, which is not a draw-call problem.

   When a spec grows past the point where it is one, merge each group's parts
   into a single geometry per surface per group. Metadata is lost by
   definition, so this is opt-in rather than the default. Merged geometries
   are new allocations: dispose them with `disposeMerged`.
