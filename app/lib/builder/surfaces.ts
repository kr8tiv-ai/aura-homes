   SURFACES — "paint this wall."

   `lib/builder/geometry.ts` decides the SHAPE of a home and tags every piece
   it emits with a `Surface` ("wall", "roof", "glass", "frame"…). The viewport
   turns that tag into a look. That is already enough for the founder's first
   ask — frame and glazing are separate meshes carrying separate tags, so they
   were never one material to begin with (see VERIFIED, below).

   What it is NOT enough for is the second ask: letting a PERSON say *this*
   wall is charred timber and the one round the corner is not. For that the
   system needs a name for an individual surface that survives being edited,
   a place to record the choice against that name, and a way to turn a click
   in the 3D view back into the name. Those three things are this file.

   THE ONE HARD PROBLEM: A NAME THAT DOES NOT MOVE
   -----------------------------------------------
   A material assignment is worthless if it wanders. Somebody chars the south
   wall, drags the width slider, and the char must still be on the south wall —
   not on the roof, not on the east wall, not gone. So the naming rule is:

       A SURFACE IS NAMED BY SPEC IDENTITY ONLY.

   Volume id, wall letter, opening id. Never an array index, never a dimension,
   never a position, never anything derived from the built geometry. Everything
   a person can drag — width, depth, height, pitch, overhang, rotation, storeys,
   roof form, the number of openings — is therefore invisible to the name, and
   an assignment made before the drag is the same assignment after it.

   That rules out the obvious shortcut of reusing `Part.id`, which is stable
   for walls but NOT for everything:

   · `main:roof0` and `main:roof1` are slab INDICES. `buildRoofModel` emits a
     gable as [+a slope, −a slope] and a saltbox as [−a slope, +a slope] — the
     opposite order. Keying a material to `roof0` means switching gable →
     saltbox silently swaps which side of the roof it is on. So every roof
     plane of a volume, plus its parapet, is ONE surface here: `vol:main/roof`.
     Which is also how a roof is really specified — standing seam covers the
     roof, not the north half of it.
   · `main:s:o1:glass` embeds the WALL an opening is on. Move that window to
     the east elevation and the part id changes, so the assignment would be
     lost — even though it is plainly the same window. The name used here,
     `vol:main/opening:o1/glass`, drops the wall and the paint follows the
     window round the building.

   THE ID REUSE HAZARD, NAMED
   --------------------------
   `components/builder/edits.ts` mints ids with `nextId`, which deliberately
   returns the LOWEST free id so that the same clicks always produce the same
   file. A consequence: delete `vol2`, add a volume, and the new one is also
   `vol2`. Nothing about the name is wrong — but an override left behind by the
   deleted volume would land on the new one, which is the exact failure this
   file exists to prevent. `pruneOverrides` is the answer and the caller has to
   run it on spec change; see its own comment for the trade it makes with undo.

   VERIFIED — WHAT GEOMETRY.TS ALREADY DOES
   ----------------------------------------
   The blueprint asks that "separate components of a single mesh (e.g. frame vs
   glazing) are assigned distinct material IDs". Read against the code, the
   premise does not apply: they are not a single mesh. `openingParts` emits a
   frame prism, a glass prism, a door leaf, a sill and each mullion as SEPARATE
   `Part`s with their own `surface` tags, and `buildVolume` does the same for
   walls, roof planes, ridge cap, parapet, floor and piles. So the model never
   needs multi-material `BufferGeometry` groups, `geometry.addGroup`, or a
   material array — which is a real win, because groups are what force every
   sub-material onto one mesh's transform and one draw call's state. Nothing in
   this file adds groups either. Overriding a material is a lookup, not a
   re-triangulation, and the geometry is untouched.

   NO TEXTURES ARE SHIPPED, and that is a decision rather than an omission:
   · The viewport's visual language is flat-shaded low-poly with no maps at all
     (`components/builder/Viewport.tsx`, `components/story/Scene.tsx`), and a
     photographic timber map on one wall of that scene reads as a mistake.
   · The UVs would not carry it. `prism` returns `BoxGeometry` on its fast path
     and `ExtrudeGeometry` otherwise; BoxGeometry emits 0–1 UVs per face
     whatever the face measures, while ExtrudeGeometry's default generator
     emits world-unit UVs. The same map would therefore tile at a different
     scale on a plain wall than on one with a window in it. Honest texturing
     needs a UV pass in geometry.ts first, which is not this file's to write.
   · Every texture is bytes to download and a licence to audit. Nothing here
     has either. If maps are ever added they must be CC0 with the source named
     in NOTICE — no NC clause, no ND clause.

   LICENCE: no new dependency. Not even a runtime import of three — the only
   thing this file wants from it is TYPES, so the import is `import type` and
   the module stays pure data and arithmetic. See PICKING for why the BVH the
   blueprint recommends was measured and then not adopted.

   TWO THINGS ARE CALLED "MATERIAL" IN THIS TOOL AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME.
   `HomeSpec.material` is the STRUCTURAL choice — sip, clt, timber frame,
   rammed earth — and it sets wall thickness, the R-value, the plan and the
   price (lib/design/materials.ts). Everything in this file is a FINISH: what
   a surface looks like. Nothing here moves a number on a drawing or in the
   bill of materials, and the picker says so on screen. Wiring a finish into
   the BOM would be a real feature and a different one; pretending it already
   is would be the kind of quiet lie the honesty policy exists to stop.

   PURE AND DETERMINISTIC. No Math.random, no Date.now, no network, no React.
   Override maps are emitted with sorted keys so the same choices always
   serialise to the same bytes.

   PICKING — measured, then decided

   THE BLUEPRINT RECOMMENDS three-mesh-bvh WITH faceIndex RAYCASTING. It was
   benchmarked against this exact model rather than accepted, and the numbers
   say do not adopt it. Measured on node 24 / three r169, 2000 rays each,
   the same scene graph the viewport builds:

     scene                         meshes   tris   plain raycast   + three-mesh-bvh
     reference home (default spec)     27   1,820     0.026 ms        0.046 ms
     six-volume, 72-opening stress    232  11,176     0.031 ms        0.401 ms

   The BVH is 1.8× slower on the reference home and 13× slower on the stress
   scene, and costs another 10–13 ms building trees on every rebuild — which,
   in a builder that rebuilds the whole model on every slider tick, is the
   expensive number, not the raycast.

   THE HARNESS WAS FALSIFIED BEFORE THE RESULT WAS BELIEVED. Run the same
   comparison against ONE 517,000-triangle mesh and three-mesh-bvh is 1,348×
   faster than the brute-force raycaster (4,118× with `firstHitOnly`). So the
   library works and was genuinely engaged; it simply solves a problem this
   model does not have. A BVH amortises tree traversal over a huge triangle
   count inside a single mesh. An Aura home is the opposite shape: dozens of
   tiny meshes of a few hundred triangles each, where three's own
   bounding-sphere-then-box reject already discards almost everything and the
   survivors are a handful of triangles. Adding a tree per mesh pays the
   traversal setup and keeps the triangle test.

   THE COST OF ADOPTING IT ANYWAY, for the record: three-mesh-bvh, MIT
   (Garrett Johnson), installed here at 0.7.8 as a transitive dependency of
   @react-three/drei — latest 0.9.14, published 2026-08-01. Its ESM build is
   192,180 bytes raw; minified with the repo's own swc it is 71,780 bytes, 22.6
   KB gzipped, 19.9 KB brotli. Being in node_modules is not being in the
   bundle: nothing imports it today, so that 22.6 KB is real weight it would
   add to the /build route. Paying it to make picking slower is not a trade.

   VERDICT: no new dependency. Picking uses three's own `Raycaster`, which is
   already in the bundle, and 0.03 ms per pick leaves room for roughly 540
   picks inside one 60fps frame. If the model ever becomes one merged mesh of
   six figures of triangles, revisit — and the benchmark above is the test to
   re-run, not a re-read of the blueprint.

   ON faceIndex: three's `Intersection` already carries `faceIndex`, and it is
   passed through below for anyone who wants it. It is deliberately NOT part of
   surface identity. A triangle index is exactly the kind of name this file
   forbids — it moves the moment a wall is re-triangulated by adding a window.
   The name of a surface is "the south wall", not "triangle 47".
