/* ===========================================================================
   PLACEABLE FIXTURES — the eco spec, made into objects you can put somewhere.

   `spec.ts` describes the SHELL: volumes, roofs, openings, a deck, a siting.
   It deliberately says nothing about what is inside, and it should not — the
   moment a wood stove becomes a field on HomeSpec, every share link, every
   drawing sheet and every export has to migrate when somebody adds a second
   one. So fixtures live HERE, in their own set, keyed to the shell by volume
   id and wall name, and the shell never learns about them.

   WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR

     · FLOOR items constrained to a floor region and snapping to walls. The
       plant: wood stove, wood-fired hot tub, water cistern, battery bank,
       HRV. The furniture: kitchen island, counter run, range, refrigerator,
       dining table, chair, sofa, armchair, bed, bunk, wardrobe, chest of
       drawers, shelving, entry bench, firewood store, drying rack, vanity,
       toilet, shower, bath.
     · WALL items snapped along a wall's run at a height, on the inside or the
       outside face: AWG unit, electrical panel, thermostat, greywater valve,
       wall-mounted heater, coat rail. WINDOWS AND DOORS ARE NOT HERE. They are
       `HomeSpec.Opening`, they are cut into the wall by geometry.ts, they are
       counted by `glazedAreaSqFt`, and a second definition of them would put
       the FDWR check and the opening schedule into permanent disagreement.
     · ROOF items snapped onto a chosen roof plane at that plane's own pitch:
       the solar array, sized in kW and drawn at the area that many modules
       actually cover.

   CLEARANCES ARE DATA, NOT DECORATION. Every kind carries a set of
   `ClearanceRule`s: named sides, real distances, a `zone` saying what KIND of
   space it is, and a `basis` + `source` saying where the number came from.
   The resolver turns them into boxes and reports what they hit. A wood stove
   whose 48-inch clearance runs into a SIP wall is a BLOCKED issue, not a
   styling choice.

   ...AND EVERY NUMBER IS MARKED. See `SOURCE_HONESTY` below. No primary
   standard was open while this file was written, so `verifiedAgainstSource`
   is `false` on every single rule and the UI is expected to say so. A figure
   attributed to a named code is a figure someone should CHECK against the
   current edition before building; a figure with no code behind it is marked
   `indicative` and is not dressed up as one.

   MORPH, NOT SCALE. A fixture resizes by changing its NAMED dimensions and
   rebuilding. Nothing is uniformly scaled, because uniform scaling is what
   makes a 10-foot island grow 5-inch-thick countertops and a king bed grow a
   4-foot headboard. In every builder below, the detail thicknesses — counter
   slab, stove legs, sofa arms, panel door lip, PV module — are CONSTANTS, and
   only the named dimensions move.

   DETERMINISM. No `Math.random`, no `Date.now`, no network. Ids are supplied
   or derived by counting; the same set always produces the same geometry and
   the same schedule.

   LICENCE / DEPENDENCIES. Nothing new. `three` (MIT) is already a dependency
   and is the only import that is not this repo's own code.

   FLOOR: THE FURNITURE PROPER

   Everything above this line is plant: it heats, stores, generates or moves
   something. What follows is what a person actually puts in the rooms, and it
   is here for the same reason the stove is — because a small house is decided
   by what fits, and a piece of furniture with an honest footprint and an
   honest clearance is a fact about the plan rather than a picture of one.
   40 sq ft of bed, chair and table in a 500 sq ft cabin is 8% of the floor.

   THE HOUSE THESE ARE FOR. Small, cold, often off grid. That is not a mood:
   it is why a firewood store is a fixture, why the entry bench has a shelf
   under it, why the drying rack carries a moisture fact and not a picture of
   a towel, why the table has a work end, and why the toilet has a composting
   option whose facts talk about temperature. Anything that could go in any
   house anywhere has been given the reason it belongs in THIS one, in its
   `blurb`, and if a piece could not be given one it is not in the file.

   EVERY NUMBER IS STILL MARKED. Almost nothing here is code. Kitchen and
   bathroom figures that come from the NKBA's published planning guidelines
   are marked `guideline` and name them; the rest — chair pull-outs, drawer
   fronts, ladder room — are `indicative`, because no document was open and
   pretending otherwise would be worse than the missing citation. The single
   exception is a wood cookstove, which is a solid-fuel appliance and carries
   the same CAN/CSA-B365 clearance the wood stove above does, cited the same
   way and just as unverified.
