/* ===========================================================================
   WALLS — the plan-editor's geometry. Pure functions, no React, no three.js
   objects, no clock, no randomness.

   WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR
   --------------------
   Until now a person composed rectangular VOLUMES with sliders. They could
   not push a single wall, and they could not say where an interior partition
   goes — the room packer in `lib/design/layout.ts` decided that for them. The
   founder's blueprint asks for "a 2D interface allowing users to move, draw,
   or delete walls and corners via mouse-driven interactions", and that is a
   real gap rather than a restatement of what is already here.

   This module is everything that gap needs which is not a pixel: the frame
   maths, snapping, hit-testing, wall offsetting, the partition model and the
   constraint solving that keeps an edit inside a spec the rest of the system
   will still accept. `components/builder/Plan2D.tsx` draws it and nothing
   else.

   THE PRIMITIVE STAYS RECTANGULAR — AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   `spec.ts` says why, in its own words: "Keeping the primitive rectangular is
   what keeps the plan engine able to solve it — an arbitrary polygon footprint
   would look freer and would quietly break the handoff to production."

   That comment was read before a line of this was written, and it was
   believed. So a corner drag here is not a free vertex move: it is a resize of
   TWO faces at once with the opposite corner pinned, which is exactly what a
   resize handle does everywhere else and which leaves the footprint a
   rectangle. A wall drag moves ONE face. Neither can produce an L out of a
   single volume — an L is two volumes, which the spec already expresses and
   the drawings already handle.

   The one genuinely new concept is the INTERIOR PARTITION, and it is
   deliberately not a polygon either: it is axis-aligned in the volume's own
   frame, because a partition at 23 degrees would have to become a room, and a
   non-rectangular room is precisely what the floor-plan sheet and the room
   solver cannot draw or fill today. Offering an angled partition would be
   offering a dead end with a pretty gesture on it.

   WHERE PARTITIONS LIVE, AND THE HONEST PART
   ------------------------------------------
   `Partition` is declared HERE, not in `spec.ts`, because that file was not
   to be edited. That has a consequence worth stating plainly rather than
   discovering later: `validateHomeSpec` in `lib/builder/share.ts` rebuilds a
   fresh spec from validated primitives ONLY, so an extra `partitions` key
   hung on a HomeSpec would be silently dropped by every share link and every
   JSON import. Partitions therefore travel as their own value, with their own
   codec below (`encodePartitions` / `decodePartitions`), until `spec.ts` and
   `share.ts` gain the field. The exact addition those two files need is
   written out in this agent's report.

   FRAME — copied from `geometry.ts`, never re-derived
   --------------------------------------------------
   · World plan is (x, z) in FEET. +x is east, +z is south, so north is −z.
   · `Volume.rotationDeg` is clockwise from north; the three.js yaw is its
     negation (`yawFromBearingDeg`), and that sign lives in geometry.ts alone.
   · A volume's local frame is centred on (v.x, v.z). Local +x runs to world
     (cos yaw, −sin yaw); local +z runs to world (sin yaw, cos yaw).
   · Local corner order matches `rectCornersPlan`: 0=(−hw,−hd) 1=(+hw,−hd)
     2=(+hw,+hd) 3=(−hw,+hd).
   · Wall n is the local −z face, s the +z face, e the +x face, w the −x face.
   · An opening's `offsetFt` is measured from the wall's LEFT end looking at it
     from outside, which is the run direction in `geometry.ts`'s `WALL_AXES`:
     n runs −x, s runs +x, e runs −z, w runs +z. The e and w walls butt into
     the n and s walls, so their run is `depthFt − 2·thickness` — that is
     `wallRunFt`, and it is imported rather than restated.

   DETERMINISM. No `Math.random`, no `Date.now`. Ids are derived from the ids
   already present, the same rule `edits.ts` follows, so the same sequence of
   drags produces the same file and the same export.

   8. THE CODEC — how partitions round-trip

   `validateHomeSpec` in `share.ts` rebuilds a spec from validated primitives
   and drops everything else, which means an extra key on HomeSpec would NOT
   survive a share link. So partitions carry their own payload with their own
   gate, built to the same rule: check the contract, then construct a fresh
   object out of checked primitives, so a hand-edited file cannot smuggle a
   field into application state.

   Deterministic: fixed key order, values quantised to a thousandth of a foot,
   `JSON.stringify` over an array. The same plan always produces the same
   string, which is what makes it safe to put in a URL beside the spec.
   =========================================================================== */
