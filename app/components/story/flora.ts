   FLORA — the botanical layer's shared core.

   Two things live here, deliberately together:

   1. THE MEADOW'S WIND, as module constants. The grass layers and the
      flowers must move in ONE weather — a flower swaying to its own clock
      next to grass swaying to another is the kind of wrongness a viewer
      feels before they can name it. So the wind direction, the gust
      envelope, and the reduced-motion frozen instant are defined once here
      and imported by every planted thing. SceneDetail's grass reads these;
      the flower material reads these; there is no second copy to drift.

   2. THE FLOWER SYSTEM — geometry, deterministic clustered placement, and
      the shader pair. One InstancedBufferGeometry, one ShaderMaterial, ONE
      draw call for every flower in the scene.

   Idea credit (owed a row in docs/CREDITS.md at integration): the
   clustered instanced-wildflower approach — low-poly petal rings on bent
   stems, planted in species-clumped drifts — was studied in
   siliconjungle/inkwell-webgpu-flowers (MIT). Ideas only: theirs is a
   WebGPU renderer with its own atlas; ours is Three/R3F GLSL and every
   vertex below is generated in code. No source or assets were copied.

   Everything is deterministic — the same hash-noise idiom the rest of the
   scene uses (sin·43758.5453), never Math.random — so the meadow is the
   same meadow on every load.

/* ============================== FLOWERS =============================
   A wildflower is three parts: a stem, a ring of petals, a centre disc.
   Two geometry tiers share one shader:

   · RICH (capable desktop, full quality): 6 diamond petals (2 tris each),
     crossed tapered stem quads, centre quad — 18 triangles, 32 vertices.
   · LOW (everything else — mobile, balanced, lite, the opening stage):
     5 single-triangle petals, same stem cross, centre quad — 11 triangles.

   Colour is species-driven in the vertex shader from three muted alpine
   families — cream, lavender, straw-gold — clumped per ~3 m world cell so
   a drift reads as one kind of flower, the way real meadows grow. No
   orange anywhere (BRAND.md section 2 has none), and values stay a step
   below the sky so heads never bloom into fireflies.

   Near/mid/far: flowers dissolve per-instance over 18–30 m of camera
   distance using the grass layers' own smooth fade-seed band (no pop, no
   hysteresis state), with the grass's anti-shimmer distance widening on
   the way out. Past 30 m the meadow surface and the grass carry the field
   — a 4 cm petal head is sub-texel out there and could only alias.
