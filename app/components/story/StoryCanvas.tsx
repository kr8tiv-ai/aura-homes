/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   WEBGL PROBE — run on render, not in an effect, and hand the context back.

   Two things were wrong with probing inside useEffect and dropping the
   result on the floor:

   1. TIMING. StoryCanvas is only ever mounted on the client (Story.tsx
      pulls it in with next/dynamic ssr:false), so there is no hydration
      mismatch to defend against — and probing in an effect meant render 0
      returned null and <Canvas> could not mount until the following
      commit. Everything three.js does starts one commit later than it
      needs to, on the exact path the founder says feels slow.
   2. LEAKED CONTEXT. Browsers cap live WebGL contexts (~16 in Chrome) and
      dropping the JS reference does not free one — the GPU context lives
      until it is garbage collected or explicitly lost. Every mount leaked
      a probe context, and on a machine already near the cap that is what
      makes the real canvas come back context-lost. WEBGL_lose_context
      hands it straight back.

   The effect below stays purely as the SSR safety net: if this ever runs
   where `document` does not exist the probe returns null and the effect
   re-runs it after mount, i.e. exactly the old behaviour.
