   THE DETAIL LAYER

   Everything here is ADDITIVE — it mounts alongside the original scene and
   removes nothing. It is also entirely procedural: no downloaded meshes, no
   textures fetched over the wire, nothing to license or credit beyond the
   techniques listed in docs/CREDITS.md. That is a performance decision as
   much as a legal one — the whole layer costs a few hundred KB of JS and no
   extra network round-trips, which matters on a page whose payload budget
   is a brand rule.

   Performance shape:
     · grass is ONE InstancedMesh with GPU wind (no per-frame CPU work)
     · mountains are three low-segment ridges, no shadows, fog-blended
     · clouds and steam are canvas-gradient sprites — no image downloads
     · the moose, hammock, netting and lights are primitive assemblies
     · every animated piece honours `frozen` (prefers-reduced-motion)

/* ============================== CLOUDS ==============================
   CLOUDS v2 — volumes, not blobs.

   v1 was 13 radial-gradient sprites: 2-4 flattened pure-white ellipses per
   cloud with a heavy gaussian alpha falloff, stacked. Stacked soft alpha
   is what produced the visibly brighter cores where two ellipses met — the
   single clearest AI-slop tell on the page — and because a sprite has no
   geometry there was no shading, no underside, no light direction at all.

   These are real (if very low-poly) volumes: 4-7 squashed icosahedra merged
   into one shell, drawn OPAQUE so nothing can stack, with the light baked
   into vertex colours — warm sunlit crown, cool grey base, graded by height
   AND by the dot product with the same key direction the scene's sun uses.
   Same low-poly language as the trees and the terrain, which is the point:
   a cloud that is made of the same stuff as the world reads as part of it.

   The band was also lowered. v1 ran y 44-78 with half-heights near 18, so
   the tallest clouds terminated exactly at the top of the hero frame and
   got hard-clipped by the viewport edge.

/* =============================== GRASS ==============================
   GRASS v6 — a meadow, not a population of sticks. (v6: the founder's
   x4-density two-layer round — see the layer comment above G_HERO.)

   WHAT CAME FROM WHERE (all credited in docs/CREDITS.md):

   · muratkamci/snakey-locomotion (MIT) — the blade itself. Quadratic-Bezier
     bend anchored at the root, 4-segment tapered strip, layered gust+ripple
     value noise, normals taken from the Bezier tangent and then ROUNDED
     across the width, backlit translucency, base ambient occlusion, the
     widen-with-distance trick that kills sub-pixel shimmer, and the clamp
     that stops single blades turning into bloom fireflies.

   · aleksandargjoreski.dev "Trimming my Grass Shader" — the LOD doctrine.
     His system is WebGPU compute + atomic compaction + indirect draw, which
     does not port to our WebGL static export, so the architecture was
     deliberately NOT copied. Four ideas were:
       1. thin blades stochastically with distance rather than clipping the
          field at a ring,
       2. weight that thinning by the blade's PROJECTED SCREEN HEIGHT, so the
          LOD tracks what you can actually resolve,
       3. seed per-blade variation from WORLD-SPACE position, never from the
          instance index, so a blade's identity is stable and the field never
          reads as a repeating pattern,
       4. treat the grass map as a CONTINUOUS HEIGHT SCALE, not as binary
          visibility — which is why grass here shortens into the path and the
          deck instead of stopping at a stencil line.
     His hysteresis (asymmetric appear/disappear thresholds) solves flicker
     for a field of blades that pop in and out as binary. Ours never pops:
     the keep test is a smooth band, so a blade shrinks to nothing over ~0.14
     of seed space. Same goal, no per-blade state to carry.

   · thebuggeddev/football — read for its endless-grassland framing only. It
     carries NO LICENSE, so nothing was copied from it. Noted and moved on.

   THE STRUCTURE, and why it is tiles:
   one giant InstancedBufferGeometry submits every blade every frame no
   matter where the camera is — thinning in the vertex shader saves fill but
   not vertex work. So the field is cut into 4 m tiles, each its own
   instanced draw with a real bounding sphere. Tiles the camera cannot see
   are frustum-culled by three for free, and each visible tile's
   `instanceCount` is trimmed per frame to the LOD keep-fraction.

   The trick that makes the trim seamless: blades inside a tile are SORTED BY
   THEIR FADE SEED at build time. The shader keeps blades whose seed is below
   the local keep-fraction, so truncating instanceCount to the same fraction
   removes exactly the blades the shader had already scaled to zero. Cutting
   vertex work costs nothing visually.

/* GRASS v6 — the founder's x4 round. "Grass x4, no ground visible, slightly
   shorter." A naive x4 of the 7-tri hero blade is ~2.7M triangles — over
   double the whole scene budget. The smart spend is TWO LAYERS:

   · HERO layer — the full 4-segment, 7-triangle bending blade, ~1.6x the old
     count. It owns the silhouette: wind, species, seed heads, tip glint.
     Its full-density radius tightens 27 m -> 18 m to pay for the count —
     density moved from the fog wash to where the camera actually looks.

   · FILLER layer — a SINGLE-TRIANGLE blade at very high density, SHORT
     (9-21 cm). It exists for exactly one job: closing the ground between
     hero blades so no bare lawn reads anywhere near the camera. At that
     height a bend has no visible mid-point, so the mid vertices would be
     pure spend — one triangle is the whole blade. Its LOD dissolves it past
     12-24 m, where the hero layer plus the darkened terrain take over.
     1 tri and a near-only LOD is why x4 blades fits inside the budget.

  /* Blade budget by device. A phone draws the whole meadow a few centimetres
     across, so blades past a few thousand are texels it physically cannot
     resolve — and it is the device least able to afford them. */
  /* GRASS IS OFF, and this is a considered verdict rather than a punt.

     Three implementations were built and shot: single-triangle blades, then
     proper 7-vertex bending blades with three-layer vertex-shader wind, then
     the same tuned right down to 5-9 cm wide, 6,000 instances, coloured
     LIGHTER than the terrain. All three read as dark speckle on the meadow
     in the render, and all three looked worse than the clean vertex-coloured
     ground this scene already had.

     The reason is the art direction, not the shader. This world is large
     flat-shaded low-poly forms, and the camera flies 5-15 m above a meadow
     it crosses in seven beats. At that distance an individual blade covers
     about a pixel, so it can only ever alias — it adds noise, not texture.
     Per-blade grass belongs to a camera that gets down into it.

     What WOULD work here, if it is wanted: treat the meadow as a SURFACE,
     not a population — a detail/noise texture on the terrain material with
     the same three-layer wind panning through its UVs, which stays coherent
     at any distance and costs one texture fetch. That is a different
     feature and it should be built deliberately, not smuggled in here.

     `GrassField` and `bladeGeometry` are kept in the file, working and
     documented, so that decision can be revisited without redoing research. */
  /* Density, not count, is what makes grass read. The reference runs ~49
     blades/m2; this ring is ~660 m2, so 34k desktop lands in the same place.
     Mobile draws the meadow a few centimetres across, so a third of that is
     indistinguishable and much kinder to the GPU. */

  /* The footprint grew from ~660 m2 to a feathered field that reaches the
     fog line, so the count grew with it — but only by half. The rest of the
     coverage comes from taller far blades and from Scrub, which is far
     cheaper per square metre than instancing more grass out there would be.
     Measured, not assumed: see the fps figures in the round-1 report. */
  /* Density is the whole game. The reference plants 16,000 blades per 18 m
     tile — ~49 blades/m2 — and that is the threshold at which blades stop
     reading as separate objects and become a surface. 48k spread across this
     meadow was roughly a third of that, which is exactly why it read as
     sparse scatter no matter how good the blade itself was. */
  /* The founder's x4, then his x3 on top of it: 96k planted blades grew to
     1.04M on desktop — 120k full 7-tri hero blades (the silhouette) + 920k
     single-triangle short filler (the carpet; see the layer comments above
     G_HERO/G_FILL). The split is what keeps it inside the ~1.3M worst-beat
     triangle budget: density lives in the near field where the eye judges
     coverage, not in the fog wash. Mobile keeps its ~35% proportion. */
  /* v9: the founder's "4x the grass in close proximity" round. Brute count
     was impossible (v8's worst beat already sat 40k tris under the 1.35M
     ceiling), so v9 closes the ground with the three cheap levers — deeper
     sward-green terrain under the meadow (zero tris), wider filler blades
     (zero tris), jittered-grid spacing so the same count leaves no voids
     (zero tris) — and spends the actual headroom here: +60k filler blades
     (1 tri each; the near-band LOD submits roughly half at the worst beat). */
  /* v10: "double it, just down around the house." The planted TOTAL holds at
     the same budget — the yard-boost mask in buildGrassTiles doubles the
     blades in the ring the close beats frame, and the far-trim (radial
     26-36 -> 20-30 m) hands back the instances to pay for it, so the worst
     beat stays under the 1.35M ceiling. Measured per beat in
     C:\tmp\aura-shots\metrics (label v10-*), not assumed. */
  /* 870k with the v10 mask measured OVER ceiling (crest 1.412M): the far
     trim shrinks the mask's effective area E, and budget/E redistributes the
     freed instances into the mid-ring the crest camera stares at. 780k puts
     the BASE density back at v9 levels — the doubling stays where it was
     aimed (the yard), paid for by the far field, not by new instances. */

     coverage — the first ~22 m the story cameras sit in. Paired with wider
     blades, a relaxed near-field height gate, and a deeper ground shade, the
