   GLASS, AND THE BRIDGE FLICKER

   The walkway to the tub used to strobe as you approached it. Two separate
   bugs stacked, and both had to go:

   1. SORT THRASH. One shared material with `depthWrite:false` meant every
      glass surface — walkway deck, its two rails, the deck panel, the deck
      rails — landed in three's transparent bucket and got re-sorted by
      centroid distance EVERY frame. Walking the bridge swept the camera
      through the point where those centroids swap, so the order flipped
      back and forth and the panels visibly popped over each other.
   2. Z-FIGHTING. The walkway glass spanned y 0.385–0.455 and its steel
      frame 0.335–0.385 — coplanar to the micron at 0.385. The deck panel
      (0.40–0.48) and its frame (0.35–0.41) actually interpenetrated.

   The fix is to stop treating structural glass and balustrade glass as the
   same thing. Floors are walked on and read as solid: they write depth and
   carry a pinned renderOrder, so their order is deterministic instead of
   camera-dependent. Rails are thin and must layer, so they keep depthWrite
   off — but they sit in a later renderOrder band, so they always resolve
   after the floors rather than racing them. polygonOffset pushes the glass
   a hair off any frame it shares a plane with, and the frames below were
   dropped to leave real air between the surfaces.

/* ---- texture sharpness plumbing (texture pass, Aug 10) ----
   Two distinct blurs were softening the procedural surfaces:
   1. RASTER BLUR — strokes drawn once into a 256/128 px canvas carry that
      canvas's antialiasing forever; magnified on a near-camera plank the
      smear is the texture. Each detail texture now draws into a backing
      store scaled by 2 x min(devicePixelRatio, 2) (ctx.scale keeps the
      pattern IDENTICAL — same rnd() sequence, same logical coords — only
      the rasterisation gets finer). The DPR term is capped at 2 so a 3x
      phone doesn't quadruple VRAM for texels its screen never resolves;
      the canvas dpr cap in StoryCanvas is 1.75 anyway.
   2. ANISOTROPY — the camera travels low across the deck and the stone
      path, and at grazing angles trilinear filtering alone collapses into
      the smallest mip. Every detail texture takes the GPU max (16 on the
      target AMD), wired from the renderer by Scene below. NOTE the soft
      radial-gradient sprites (smoke, mist, steam, glow, sun shafts) are
      deliberately NOT resized or filtered differently: a smooth gradient
      has no detail above its own smoothness, so a bigger store is the
      same pixels — measured as a no-op and skipped, not forgotten.
   Mip settings are the three.js defaults, asserted here so a future
   refactor cannot silently drop to non-mipped filtering (which is what
   makes mid-distance detail shimmer). colorSpace stays per-texture: sRGB
   where the texture carries colour, linear for the water normal map. */

   The sky was the stillest region of every frame — a gradient with a few

   call and 16 triangles.

   Each bird is a shallow V of two triangles. They ride one slow circling
   path at different radii, heights and phases, so the flock spreads and
   gathers the way a real one does instead of orbiting in formation. The
   "wingbeat" is a scale oscillation on the local X axis — at this distance
   a wing flap and a horizontal squash are indistinguishable, and squash
   costs one multiply against a skeleton's everything.

   FROZEN (prefers-reduced-motion): the matrices are written once on mount

 *  v1 built the pane, cap and channel as boxes inside ONE group and rotated
 *  the whole group about its centre. Rotating a box rakes its END FACES too —
 *  they come out perpendicular to the slope rather than plumb. On this flight
 *  (0.98 m run, 0.355 m fall) that swung the top of each end 0.29 m along the
 *  run, so the handrail started a third of a metre inboard of its newel and
 *  visibly floated. A real stair balustrade is a PARALLELOGRAM: the top and
 *  bottom edges follow the rake, and the two end edges stay PLUMB.
 *
 *  So nothing here is a rotated box spanning the whole run:
 *   · the pane is explicit geometry — four corners, plumb ends, built from the
 *     two newel lines, so it cannot drift out of contact with them;
 *   · the cap and the channel are boxes that span NEWEL-TOP TO NEWEL-TOP (and
 *     nosing to nosing), each rotated only to align its long axis, and each
 *     over-run slightly at both ends so it dies INTO the newel instead of
 *     stopping on its centreline and leaving a hairline;
 *   · the newels are plumb, and sized so the cap lands on top of them.
 *
 *  `drop` is how far the bottom newel continues past the rail to reach the
 *  ground, since the terrain falls away under the last tread.

/* THE BRIDGE, AND THE BEAMS THROUGH THE HOT TUB.

   v1 ran the walkway from the deck edge (3.45, 4.65) to (5.9, 5.35) — which
   is the CENTRE of the hot tub, not its edge — and then padded the deck box
   by another 0.4 m. Its two handrails were offset by an eyeballed (-0.35,
   +0.42) instead of a real perpendicular, so both of them ended up inside
   the 0.78 m barrel: the "two grey beams passing straight through the tub
   wall and out the other side". Now the landing point is solved rather than
   guessed — the deck stops 0.96 m short of the tub centre (the barrel is
   0.78) and the rails are offset along the true perpendicular, so every
   piece clears the staves and lands on the stone pad instead.

/* ---------------------------- hotspots: REMOVED ----------------------
   Three <Html> markers used to float over the glass gable, the solar array
   and the hot tub — a teal dot in a pale ring, drawn on a DOM layer above
   the canvas. They were removed on request: because they are screen-space
   HTML rather than scene geometry they never scaled with distance, so at
   every camera beat they sat on the composition at a fixed 20px like
   interface stuck to a landscape, and they reappeared at intervals through
   the whole scroll.

   WHAT WENT WITH THEM, so it is not silently lost: each carried a one-line
   published spec — triple-glazed south face for passive gain in zone 7A,
   the 6.4 kW array with the honest note that December needs the wood stove,
   and the wood-fired cedar tub drawing no grid power. None of those claims
   are orphaned; all three are stated on /overview and priced on /budget,
   which is where a reader can actually act on them.

          subtle, but the n8ao pass resolves a depth-STENCIL buffer that this AMD
          driver rejects with GL_INVALID_OPERATION on glBlitFramebuffer ~256x per
          frame — independent of halfRes or the composer's multisampling, so not
          fixable from the app side — and its full-res mode nearly halved the

          shadows (now PCSS-softened) and the terrain's meadow-shade fake AO.
