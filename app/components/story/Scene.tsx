   GLASS, AND THE BRIDGE FLICKER

   The walkway to the tub used to strobe as you approached it. Two separate
   bugs stacked, and both had to go:

   1. SORT THRASH. One shared material with `depthWrite:false` meant every
      glass surface — walkway deck, its two rails, the deck panel, the deck
      rails — landed in three's transparent bucket and got re-sorted by
      centroid distance EVERY frame. Walking the bridge swept the camera
      through the point where those centroids swap, so the order flipped
      back and forth and the panels visibly popped over each other.
   2. Z-FIGHTING. The walkway glass spanned y 0.385–0.455 and its steel
      frame 0.335–0.385 — coplanar to the micron at 0.385. The deck panel
      (0.40–0.48) and its frame (0.35–0.41) actually interpenetrated.

   The fix is to stop treating structural glass and balustrade glass as the
   same thing. Floors are walked on and read as solid: they write depth and
   carry a pinned renderOrder, so their order is deterministic instead of
   camera-dependent. Rails are thin and must layer, so they keep depthWrite
   off — but they sit in a later renderOrder band, so they always resolve
   after the floors rather than racing them. polygonOffset pushes the glass
   a hair off any frame it shares a plane with, and the frames below were
   dropped to leave real air between the surfaces.

/* ---- texture sharpness plumbing (texture pass, Aug 10) ----
   Two distinct blurs were softening the procedural surfaces:
   1. RASTER BLUR — strokes drawn once into a 256/128 px canvas carry that
      canvas's antialiasing forever; magnified on a near-camera plank the
      smear is the texture. Each detail texture now draws into a backing
      store scaled by 2 x min(devicePixelRatio, 2) (ctx.scale keeps the
      pattern IDENTICAL — same rnd() sequence, same logical coords — only
      the rasterisation gets finer). The DPR term is capped at 2 so a 3x
      phone doesn't quadruple VRAM for texels its screen never resolves;
      the canvas dpr cap in StoryCanvas is 1.75 anyway.
   2. ANISOTROPY — the camera travels low across the deck and the stone
      path, and at grazing angles trilinear filtering alone collapses into
      the smallest mip. Every detail texture takes the GPU max (16 on the
      target AMD), wired from the renderer by Scene below. NOTE the soft
      radial-gradient sprites (smoke, mist, steam, glow, sun shafts) are
      deliberately NOT resized or filtered differently: a smooth gradient
      has no detail above its own smoothness, so a bigger store is the
      same pixels — measured as a no-op and skipped, not forgotten.
   Mip settings are the three.js defaults, asserted here so a future
   refactor cannot silently drop to non-mipped filtering (which is what
   makes mid-distance detail shimmer). colorSpace stays per-texture: sRGB
   where the texture carries colour, linear for the water normal map. */
