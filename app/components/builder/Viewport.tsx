/* ===========================================================================
   THE VIEWPORT — the HomeSpec, on screen, while you are still changing it.

   `lib/builder/geometry.ts` decides the SHAPE and this file decides the LOOK,
   and the `surface` tag on each part is the entire contract between them. That
   split is why a roof can change form without a single colour moving, and why
   a night palette is eleven lines rather than a rewrite.

   THE VISUAL LANGUAGE is the one `components/story/Scene.tsx` established for
   the landing page: flat-shaded low-poly, standard materials, roughness doing
   the work, no textures, no post-processing. This builder has to look like it
   belongs to the same world as the home on the front page, because it is
   supposed to be the same home.

   THREE THINGS THIS FILE IS CAREFUL ABOUT
   ---------------------------------------
   1. IT OWNS NO GEOMETRY. Every BufferGeometry arrives built and is disposed
      by whoever built it (`BuilderApp`), so every mesh here carries
      `dispose={null}` — without it R3F would free buffers the builder still
      holds a reference to, and the model would vanish mid-drag.
   2. THE HOUSE GROUP IS THE EXPORT ROOT. `houseRef` wraps the volumes, the
      deck and whatever `houseChildren` puts beside them — and NOTHING else:
      no ground, no grid, no sun, no selection glow. That is what makes the
      .glb a building rather than a screenshot of an editor. The editor
      furniture also carries `EXPORT_IGNORE` as a second belt, in case
      somebody later hands a wider subtree to the exporter.
   3. IT RENDERS ON DEMAND. `frameloop="demand"` means no frame is drawn
      unless something changed — a 3D view idling at 60fps on a laptop for the
      twenty minutes somebody spends reading the plan below it is a battery
      bill for nothing. `<Refresh>` invalidates whenever React re-renders the
      scene, and drei's OrbitControls invalidates while you drag.

      VW03 — WHAT THE PHONE GETS, DECIDED RATHER THAN INHERITED. The three
      options on the table were a still image, a poster frame you tap to
      start, and a live canvas that does not animate. It is the third, and the
      reason is rule 2 above rather than anything about phones: this canvas is
      the EXPORT ROOT. Swapping it for an <img> below some width means the
      .glb and .obj writers have no group to serialise and the project library
      has no scene to thumbnail, on exactly the device most likely to be the
      only one somebody owns. So it stays live, and the cost that would have
      justified removing it — a WebGL context redrawing sixty times a second in
      a pocket — is the cost `frameloop="demand"` was already not paying:
      `BuilderSceneQuality.frameloop` in `lib/three/sceneQuality.ts` is typed
      to the literal `"demand"`, so no capability tier can turn this into an
      animation loop.

      That was TRUE and UNASSERTED, which is the same as unowned. It is now
      measured from the outside in `tests/builder-mobile.spec.ts`: the spec
      counts real WebGL draw calls at 390x844, proves the counter moves when
      the model is orbited, and then proves it does not move at all while the
      page sits idle.

   FINISHES ARE OPTIONAL AND ADDITIVE (added when the surface picker landed).
   The `SURFACES` table below is still the whole look of this file when no
   `surfaces` prop is passed — the default look, the night glass glow, the
   flat shading, the no-shadow rule for glass and water, all unchanged. When
   the prop IS passed, `materialForPart` answers the same question with one
   extra step: a per-surface override if the person set one, otherwise the
   surface's default — and `DEFAULT_MATERIAL` in `lib/builder/surfaces.ts`
   reproduces this table value for value, so passing the prop with an empty
   override map renders exactly what it rendered before.

   THE CUT IS A MATERIAL PROPERTY, NOT A RENDERER SETTING. `localClippingEnabled`
   is the only renderer state touched, and the planes are attached to the house
   materials alone — so the ground, the grid, the comfort plates and the sun
   marker are never sliced, and the geometry the .glb writer serialises is
   untouched by a cut that only ever lived in a fragment shader.

   THE ISOLATION GHOSTS, IT DOES NOT HIDE. `soloVolumeIds` names the volumes
   that stay solid and the rest are drawn at `GHOST_OPACITY` with no shadow —
   deliberately NOT `visible={false}`, because three's GLTFExporter defaults to
   `onlyVisible: true` and `exportGlb` passes that default through, so hiding a
   floor to look at another one would quietly ship half a house in the .glb. */

 * 1. IT IS A SIBLING OF THE EXPORT ROOT, never a child, and every mesh carries
 *    `EXPORT_IGNORE`. A .glb of an Aura home does not contain a comfort study
 *    any more than it contains the lawn or the selection glow.
 * 2. IT OWNS ITS GEOMETRY THE WAY `Site` AND `SelectionPlate` DO — an inline
 *    `planeGeometry`, built and freed by R3F. Rule 1 in the header is about
 *    the BufferGeometries `BuilderApp` hands over; nothing here is one.
 * 3. IT DOES NOT LIGHT. `meshBasicMaterial`, so a plate reads as the same
 *    colour at midnight as at noon — a heatmap that changed hue with the sun
 *    slider would be a heatmap you could not read.
 *
 * IT IS AN X-RAY, AND THAT IS THE ONLY WAY IT WORKS. The plates lie on the
 * FINISHED FLOOR, which is inside the shell, under the roof — depth-tested
 * they would be invisible from every camera position this viewport allows.
 * So `depthTest` is off and `renderOrder` puts them last: the overlay draws
 * over the building, the way an analysis layer in any BIM viewer does. It is
 * unmistakably a diagram rather than a surface of the house, which is exactly
 * what it is, and it is off by default so the model still reads as a house.
 *
 * The plates are inset a few inches so two rooms sharing a wall read as two
 * rooms rather than one wash of colour.

   there is not a literal colour in it. The three swatches resolve through the
   tonal ladder to the SAME hexes `HEAT` mirrors for the scene, which is what
   keeps a legend swatch and the plate it describes the same colour in both
   themes.

   THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE IN THE LEGEND, not in a panel three tabs away. A colour
   scale for a comfort figure is meaningless without the temperature and the
   humidity that produced it, so they are printed here, on the view, every
   time the overlay is on. */
